OVERVIEW

This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a penguin dataset, focusing on biometric measurements and categorical variables such as species, island, and sex.

DATASET

Features: Culmen length & depth, flipper length, body mass, species, island, sex.

ANALYSIS

Goals: Explore correlations and distributions of biometric measurements across species, islands and sexes.

Key Findings

- Culmen length and culmen depth have a weak negative correlation of -0.23.
- Culmen length and flipper length have a strong positive correlation of 0.65.
- Culmen length and body mass have a strong positive correlation of 0.59.
- Culmen depth and flipper length have a strong negative correlation of -0.58.
- Culmen depth and body mass have a moderate negative correlation of -0.47.
- Flipper length and body mass have a very strong positive correlation of 0.89.
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins exhibit similar median culmen lengths, but Adelie's distribution skews slightly lower.
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have relatively similar distributions, with both exhibiting a median culmen depth around 18.45-18.5 mm.
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins share a similar median flipper length of approximately 196-196.5 mm, while Gentoo penguins have a considerably longer flipper length, with a median of around 216 mm.
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have similar median body masses, around 3700-3950 g.
- Males typically exhibit sexual dimorphism as shown by greater biometric measurements compared to females.

METHODOLOGY

- Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- Techniques: Data cleaning, correlation analysis, and visualization

RESULTS

- Visualized distributions and correlations between features.
- Highlighted the relationship between biometric measurements and categorical variables
